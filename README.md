# Semantically-aware Mask CycleGAN (SMCycleGAN)

This repository is for the work of SMCycleGAN, which is built based on [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) and used for translating artistic portraits to photo-realistic visualizations. This model is developed for the course project of COMP4711 in HKUST by YIN Zhuohao.
